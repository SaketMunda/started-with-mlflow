# Getting Started with MLFlow

  1. Core Components of MLFlow
  2. Why Use MLFlow
  3. Who uses MLFlow
  4. Usecase of MLFlow

## How Data Scientists leverages MLFlow

  1. Experiment tracking and hyporthesis Testing
  2. Code Structuring
  3. Model Packaging and dependency management
  4. Evaluating hyperparameter tuning
  5. Compare the results of models retraining over time.

## How ML Engineer / MLOps Professional leverages MLFlow

  1. Manage the lifecycle of trained models, both pre and post deployment
  2. Deploy models security to the production environment
  3. Manage deployment dependencies

Due to GenAI now __Prompt Engineering Users__ are also using MLFlow for some tasks like,

  1. Evaluate and Experiment with large language models
  2. Create custom prompts and experiment
  3. Deciding on the best base model suitable for project requirements

## Usecases of MLFlow

  1. Experiment tracking
  2. Model selection and Deployment
  3. Model performance monitoring
  4. Collaborative project
